                            Have you ever wondered how much snow has fallen in your favorite 
                            ski resort over the years or how it compares to other regions?<br>
                            Do you want to see the real effect of global 
                            warming on our Alps?<br> <br>
                            <b>Here we have something for you!</b> <br> <br>
                            Our project aims to visualize trends, over the past
                            decades, in the <i>snow depth</i> and <i>the amount of
                            snowfall</i> in the European Alps (and some close locations). These 
                            long-term observations help to examine and associate how
                            climate change impacts alpine ecosystems in different regions.  Our
                            data visualization may help researchers determine where the amounts of
                            snow are decreasing, to address the problem of less snow and to protect the
                            environment.

                            The alpine glaciers are especially vulnerable to rising temperatures
                            because they present relatively little ice cover.  In such a mountain
                            range, global warming is further accentuated by what is referred to as
                            the feedback effect: like a mirror, glaciers reflect solar energy.  If
                            the surface area of the mirror is reduced, the amount of reflection
                            also decreases and the sun heats the planet even more.<br> <br>
                            Therefore, temperatures in the Alps are warming at about 0.3Â°C per
                            decade, twice as fast as the global average. Moreover, temperatures
                            have risen across seasons, precipitation patterns have changed, and
                            extreme precipitation events have increased in frequency and
                            severity. According to some 2019 projections, Alpine glaciers will
                            lose more than 80% of their current mass by 2100 if greenhouse gas
                            emissions continue to rise.
